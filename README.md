# type-safe-change-case

Due to the type-recursive limitation issue, we can't make exact type inference for strings over 15 characters yet, but we will continue to optimize them. This project is inspired by a library called [`change-case`](https://github.com/blakeembrey/change-case) and aims to create a type-safe convention change library.
